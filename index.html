            Hello, my name is Ivelisse Cintron. I am currently a student in Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp. 
            In six months I will be graduating from bootcamp as a full stack web developer.
            My motivation for completing this Bootcamp is to be in a field where I will be able to express myself creatively. </p>
        <p> I am inspired by taking an idea in my head and making it a reality. 
            The web development field is clearly growing at a rapid pace with many opportunities for advancement. 
            My end goal after graduation is to become a freelance web developer. 
            From there with using the knowledge and skills I have learned in the Bootcamp I would like to be a full time web developer.
        </p>
